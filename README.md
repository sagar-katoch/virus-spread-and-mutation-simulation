 
🧬 Virus Spread and Mutation Simulation
This project simulates how a virus spreads and mutates through a population over time. It models infection dynamics and tracks key metrics like susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, helping visualize how mutations influence viral outbreaks.

🔍 Features
📈 Simulation of virus spread across a population

🧪 Dynamic mutation modeling

👥 Population tracking (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered)

🛠 Adjustable parameters: infection rate, mutation rate, population size

📊 Simple visualization of simulation results

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/sagar-katoch/virus-spread-and-mutation-simulation.git
cd virus-spread-and-mutation-simulation
2. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the simulation:
bash
Copy
Edit
python simulate.py
You can tweak parameters directly in simulate.py or config.py to explore different outcomes.
