# Virus Spread and Mutation Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the spread and mutation of a virus within a population. It models the virus's evolution, spread dynamics, and the impact of mutations over time, providing insights into viral behavior and population health.

## Features

- Simulates virus spread and mutation.
- Tracks population dynamics (susceptible, infected, recovered).
- Customizable parameters (mutation rate, spread rate, population size).
- Basic visualization of spread and mutation.
