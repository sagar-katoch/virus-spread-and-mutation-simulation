# Virus Spread and Mutation Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the spread of a virus and its mutation over time. The purpose of this simulation is to model how a virus can evolve, spread among individuals, and adapt through mutations. It is a simplified model for understanding viral dynamics and can be used for educational purposes or to demonstrate the basic concepts of disease spread and genetic mutations.

## Features

- **Virus Spread Simulation**: Simulates how a virus spreads through a population over time.
- **Mutation Mechanism**: The virus undergoes mutations at certain intervals, introducing new variants.
- **Population Dynamics**: Tracks the health status of individuals in the population (e.g., susceptible, infected, recovered).
- **Customizable Parameters**: You can customize the virus's mutation rate, spread rate, population size, and more.
- **Visualization**: Includes basic visualization of how the virus spreads and evolves over time.

## Installation

To run the simulation, you need to have Python 3.x installed. You can clone the repository and install the dependencies using `pip`.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sagar-katoch/virus-spread-and-mutation-simulation.git
cd virus-spread-and-mutation-simulation
Step 2: Install Dependencies
If you have pip installed, you can run the following command to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the simulation by executing the main Python script. Here's an example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python simulate.py
The simulation will run, and youâ€™ll be able to visualize the virus spread and mutations over time.

Parameters
You can customize the following parameters in the config.py or simulate.py file:

Population Size: The total number of individuals in the simulation.

Initial Infection Rate: The percentage of initially infected individuals.

Mutation Rate: The rate at which the virus undergoes mutations.

Spread Rate: The rate at which the virus spreads among individuals.

Simulation Duration: How long the simulation runs.
